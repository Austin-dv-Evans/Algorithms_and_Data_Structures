This repo is a collection of Algorithms and Data Structures.

I am in the middle of Colt Steele's Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass.

These are my notes and implementations of problems discussed throughout the course.

I highly recommend this course to any one interested. This course is preparing me for my upcoming technical interviews and is extremly well put together. 

If anyone would like to look over these algorithms with me please feel free
to contact me!
