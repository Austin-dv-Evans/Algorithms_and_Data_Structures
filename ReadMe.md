This repo is a collection of Algorithms and Data Structures.

I am in the middle of Colt Steele's Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass.

These are my notes and implementations of problems discussed throughout the class.

I highly recommend this course to any one interested. This course is preparing me for my upcoming technical interviews and is extremly well put together.
